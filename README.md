#Advent Of Code (2015)

##What Is This?
This is my repository for the 2015 Advent Of Code challenge. A set of 50 programming challenges spaced out over 25 days leading up to christmas. The 
general idea is you prove how much you suck by failing day two and never comitting anything new.

##Yeah, But Why?
Honestly, I can't give a single project my full attention for longer than a day any more and this is the most programmming I'll do in my spare time for 
a while. So boredom. Boredom is your answer.

##What's The Plan (Fam)?
I was going to write these all in Bash because I hate myself. But I might take inspiration from a friend ([Profans' 
Repo](https://github.com/profan/advent-of-code-2015/)) and try and use a new language for each day (that's 25 languages kids!). 
I don't think I actually *know* 25 languages mind.
